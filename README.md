# Piggy Bank App

Piggy Bank App is part of a final project called Personal Expenses Tracking App (PETA) 
from Illinois State University (ISU). It is a mobile App designed to make people gain 
control over their own expenses.

## PETA Project

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile App to serve as 
an easy and enjoyable tool to help people have more control over their outgoings 
and savings by allowing them to handle transactions over time and review their 
spending through some reports, graphs, and statistical insights. 

## Software

This App adopts the last version of the following open-source software:

- [React Native Framework](https://reactnative.dev)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org) 

## Run

After cloning the code, you first need to install the `node` dependencies:

### `npm install`

Then, you can **run** the app in the development mode:

### `npm start`

The App will be available in your browser at 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

It has live-reload implemented, so it will reload 
if you make any changes in the code
